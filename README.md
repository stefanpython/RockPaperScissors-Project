# RockPaperScissors-Project

##### This is my very first javascript project with almost no prior experience. 

#### Key Takeaway:
* Gained a better understanding of javascript functions.
    * Learned how to write functions and use them within other functions (awsome stuff).
    * Learned about the power of "console.log()" for debugging.
    * Gained a deeper apreciation for The Odin Project community and for learning in general.


###### Will return in future TOP lessons to add some visuals to the game.



#### Update:
- After finishing the DOM Manipulation and Events lecture, I`ve added some more knowledge to my brain.
    * Added an UI to the game.
    * I learned how to:
        * add event listeners for multiple buttons.
        * use query selectors.
        * how to change a div text with textContent/innerHTML.
        * use .remove() function to remove buttons after finishing a process
        * use location.reload() to refresh the page
        * add 'visibility' or 'hidden' with .style.visibilty = ''.
        * and a few more things.

###### The project was a bit hard for me at the beginning, but a few hours in and I was rolling. This was a fun project and I loved every minute of it.

### Special Thanks to the Community for making this possible for me and others.
