# RockPaperScissors-Project

##### This is my very first javascript project with 0 prior experience. 

#### Key Takeaway:
* Gained a better understanding of javascript functions.
    * Learned how to write functions and use them within other functions (awsome stuff).
    * Learned about the power of "console.log()" for debugging.
    * Gained a deeper apreciation for The Odin Project community and for learning in general.
